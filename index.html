This is "Alsina", the Vsauce font. It is named in honor of its creator! 

Click the `Preview` button to preview the font on the canvas! 

If the font seems strange, click on the preview button again. (It's like a cache bug or something, idk how to fix it.)

Some languages that uses word segmentation; Japanese, Burmese, Chinese, etc. are not supported. You can try writing if you want to test!

This canvas can go on forever though the scrolling gets harder.</textarea>
